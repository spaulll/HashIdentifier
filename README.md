# HashLens

A simple hash identifier made with basic HTML, CSS and pyscript

## PyScript 

PyScript is a framework to run simple as well as rich python programs directly in a web browser. It uses HTML's interface and the power of Pyodide, MicroPython and WASM, and modern web technologies. 
PyScript can be used in replacement of Java Script. But keep in  mind that PyScript is very slow.
